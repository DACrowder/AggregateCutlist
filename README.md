# AggregateCutlist
OnShape features for creating unified cutlist &amp; accessing frame-profiles in the BOM


Unfortunately, because OnShape frames does not profile endcaps, like other parts that aren't explicitly profiled (i.e. not created from Frame tool), the information will be labeled 'Not Set'. A desirable update would be to combine in other feature scripts which can dimension extrudes/thickens/sweeps/etc., in order to develop a comprehensive BOM/cutlist tool.
